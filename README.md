# Product Demand Prediction — Machine Learning Project  
*Student project developed using Google Colab. My contribution included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model experimentation.*

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing product demand patterns using machine learning techniques. The goal is to study product features and sales-related attributes in order to better understand factors that may influence demand levels.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Explore demand-related trends through EDA  
- Identify key features related to product demand  
- Experiment with simple machine learning models

## Methodology
The project includes:
- Handling missing and duplicate values  
- Removing irrelevant features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature understanding and model experimentation

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab
